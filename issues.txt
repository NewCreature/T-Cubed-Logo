T Cubed Logo Issues
-------------------

[ ]Create animation that rotates the shape 9/8 turns and tilts to 0.5.

[ ]Modularize logo into a single .c/.h combo so it can be imported into other
   projects.

[ ]Include a single function call that will run through the animation and show
   it on the display.

[ ]Expose an API so the logo can animated and rendered in other contexts.
